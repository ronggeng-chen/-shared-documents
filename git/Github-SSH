#### GitHub SSH

### 0. Preparation


```shell
## Check if there is an SSH key locally; if it exists, skip the first step
cd ~/.ssh

```

##### 1.Generate SSH Private Key

```shell
## Command to generate a private key
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "XXXXX@gmail.com"

> Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
## Optional: You can enter a name; the default is id_ed25519 (based on the key type).
> Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\17578/.ssh/id_ed25519):

## Enter passphrase
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):

## Re-enter passphrase
> Enter the same passphrase again:

## Parameter meanings:
## -t: Specify the key type, default is RSA, and can be omitted.
##      RSA (default): RSA key pair, usually specified with -t rsa.
##      DSA: DSA key pair, specified with -t dsa.
##      ECDSA: ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) key pair, specified with -t ecdsa.
##      Ed25519: Ed25519 key pair, specified with -t ed25519. This is a modern and highly secure public key encryption algorithm.
## -C: Set a comment, such as an email (will be placed in the public key).
## -f: Specify the key file storage filename.

```

##### 2.View Private Key

```shell
cd ~/.ssh

## Open the *.pub file with an editing tool
## For example, open id_ed25519.pub with an editing tool
## Copy the entire content
```
